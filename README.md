The ultimate countdown to find out if trees or mountains appear the most in the Bob Ross TV series
By sourcing data from https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w50#, was able to find a complete catalogue of every element painted in Bob Ross's show 'The Joy of Painting'. 
After reviewing the data it is apparent the beloved painter's favorite thing to paint was indeed trees! I chose blue for icy mountains and green for trees to make the data even more visually appealing.
